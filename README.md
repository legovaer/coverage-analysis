# Coverage Runner

**Coverage Runner** is a PHP application that allows a user to perform a code coverage analysis while executing a single
PHP file.

## Requirements

PHP 5.3 is required but the latest version of PHP is highly recommended.

## Installation

To add Coverage Runner as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a dependency on 
`legovaer/coverage-runner` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file
that just defines a dependency on Coverage Runner 1.0:

    {
        "require": {
            "legovaer/coverage-runner": "^2"
        }
    }

## Executing Coverage Runner

Coverage Runner requires only one argument, which is the location of your PHP file:

```bash
$> ./bin/coverage-runner /tmp/my-awesome-script.php
```

As soon as Coverage Runner is finished with executing your PHP script, you will notice that Coverage Runner created a
new folder in the root of your project: `code-coverage-html-report`

### Output Formats
Coverage Runner supports three output formats: HTML, XML & Clover (which can be used for coveralls.io). By default,
Coverage Runner will use "HTML" as the output format. If you want to export the report as clover, you have to provide a
`--format` option:

```bash
$> ./bin/coverage-runner /tmp/my-awesome-script.php --format clover
```

You can also specify multiple formats:

```bash
$> ./bin/coverage-runner /tmp/my-awesome-script.php --format clover,xml
```

### Output Location
Specifying an alternative output location can be done via the `--output` option. In this example we will be generating
a HTML report (which is generated by default) to the folder `/tmp/my-awesome-coverage-report`:

```bash
$> ./bin/coverage-runner /tmp/my-awesome-script.php --output /tmp/my-awesome-coverage-report
```
